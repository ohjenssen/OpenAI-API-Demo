# OpenAI API - Demo
This repository is created as a demonstration on how to use OpenAI's API to access AI models and implement in your own application. In this case study, the aim is to explain how to get started with the API works and give some idea of how you can use it.

## Short introduction
From OpenAI's page:
- We’re releasing an API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI. Unlike most AI systems which are designed for one use-case, the API today provides a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, allowing users to try it on virtually any English language task. You can now request access in order to integrate the API into your product, develop an entirely new application, or help us explore the strengths and limits of this technology.
